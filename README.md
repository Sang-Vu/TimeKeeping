# TimeKeeping
This program is for people who work from home to do timekeeping for themselves.

Nowadays, more and more people work at home. So companies need management tools for these people such as timekeeping, reporting, handing over work…
This is a program that helps us to manage the work time of employees.
The program has 3 types of accounts: Administrator-President, Manager, and Normal user. The Normal user uses the program to take timekeeping for him, see his timekeeping table. The Manager uses the program to take timekeeping for him, see his timekeeping table; and can see the timekeeping table of normal users. The Administrator-President has administrator privilege, to see all employees’ info, and the timekeeping table of all employees; grants Admin privilege to anyone.
